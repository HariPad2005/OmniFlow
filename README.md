# üåê OmniFlow
**Autonomous, Privacy-Aware, Cross-Chain Wallet Automation using Avail √ó Lit Protocol √ó Arcology**

> Turn your crypto wallet into an **AI-like finance agent** that reacts to on-chain events ‚Äî bridging, swapping, and managing assets automatically across chains.

## üöÄ Overview

**OmniFlow** is a next-generation wallet automation platform designed for creators, DAOs, and Web3 users.  
Instead of manually tracking balances and executing transactions, your wallet becomes **self-managing** ‚Äî reacting to live blockchain states and automating multi-chain operations securely.

Example automations:
- ‚ÄúIf my **Base** wallet balance < 0.01 ETH ‚Üí **bridge** 0.05 ETH from Polygon.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIf monthly revenue > $500 ‚Üí **auto-swap** 10% to USDC and **deposit** into Aave.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIf gas prices drop ‚Üí **batch-send** NFT royalties to team wallets.‚Äù

## üß© Core Components

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Avail** | [Avail Nexus](https://availproject.org) | Orchestrates and validates multi-chain transactions & intents |
| **Lit Protocol** | [Lit](https://litprotocol.com) | Secures programmable conditions & access (only owner can trigger actions) |
| **Arcology** | [Arcology Network](https://arcology.network) | Executes multiple rule checks in parallel for high-throughput automation |
| **Frontend** | React / Next.js | UI for users to create and monitor automation rules |
| **Backend** | FastAPI / Node.js | Handles rule execution logs, simulations, and notifications |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Define Rules (Intents)**  
   Users set up simple automation logic like:  
   `if wallet.balance < 0.01 ‚Üí bridge(0.05, from=Polygon, to=Base)`

2. **Encrypt Rules with Lit Protocol**  
   Each rule is encrypted and signed ‚Äî only the owner‚Äôs wallet (DID) can decrypt or trigger it.

3. **Parallel Evaluation via Arcology**  
   Arcology runs multiple rule checks simultaneously, ensuring near-instant responsiveness.

4. **Cross-Chain Execution via Avail**  
   Avail connects chains, executing actions atomically and ensuring transaction integrity.

5. **User Notification**  
   OmniFlow updates the dashboard in real time with execution results and transaction proofs.

## üß† Why It‚Äôs Unique

> Most dashboards let you view. OmniFlow lets you **react**.

- üîê **Privacy-Aware:** Rules are encrypted with Lit ‚Äî no one can read your thresholds or actions.  
- ‚ö° **Parallel Logic:** Arcology enables large-scale, simultaneous triggers.  
- üåâ **Cross-Chain Orchestration:** Avail ensures seamless multi-chain interoperability.  
- ü§ñ **Autonomous UX:** Turns wallets into self-governing financial agents.
